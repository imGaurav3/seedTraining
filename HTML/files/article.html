                “Dear Students & Youth of India, It’s not good enough just to feel for India. At times like these it’s critical to show that you’re Indian & won’t allow India to be destroyed by hatred. Join me today at 3 PM at Raj Ghat, to protest against the hate & violence unleashed on India by Modi-Shah,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.
